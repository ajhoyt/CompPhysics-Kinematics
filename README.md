# Soccer Ball 2D Motion Project

From Introduction to Mathematical and Computational Methods in Physics.

Approximates changes in projectile motion given initial conditions like speed and angle, as well as drag and wind. 

Unfortunately some of the math in markdown does not render on GithHub, please [see the pdf for the final report](https://github.com/ajhoyt/CompPhysics-Kinematics/blob/main/project1report.pdf). 
Enjoy!
